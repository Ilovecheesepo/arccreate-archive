# ArcCreate Archive

An archive of charts posted in the [ArcCreate Discord Server](https://discord.gg/x5AqMQkyck), to be used in [ArcCreate](https://github.com/Arcthesia/ArcCreate). 

If you have posted your chart in ArcCreate Discord's Chart Repository, I will eventually get to those charts. 

If you have any charts or packs you want me to upload \(Or I missed out\), likewise, [contact me](CONTACT) and e-mail me the file. 

Sending an issue is not preferred. It is possible for the repository to be deleted and re-uploaded. Regardless, I will keep the link the same after re-upload. 

Merge requests are welcome. 

If the admins would like to take over this repository, I will be happy to hand it over to them. 

## Statistics

Interesting observations can be seen in [stats](https://github.com/ArcCreate-Archival-Team/arccreate-archive/tree/main/stat). 

## Takedowns 

If you do not wish for me to archive those charts, please [contact me](CONTACT). I will delete the git repository, and re-upload it without your entry. That way, it will not be accessible through commit history, either. 

## Contributing 

Feel free to open a fork and open a merge request into this repository. 

Posting others' charts without their consent is not allowed. 

## Recruiting

Due to time and manpower constraints, it is unfeasible to enter non-parsable data manually. Currently, the chart constants stored in the database are fully extrated from the arcpkg file via [arcpkg-rd](http://github.com/arccreate-archival-team/arcpkg-rd). This may or may not affect the data and statistics from the dataset.

Moreover, artists will have aliases and collaborations. This makes it difficult to figure out who is the most popular artist.
